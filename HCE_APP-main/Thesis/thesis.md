# Chapter 4: Design, Implementation, and Testing

## Overview
The HCE (Health Companion for Elder People) project is a comprehensive health monitoring system designed to assist elderly individuals in tracking vital health metrics such as heart rate and SpO2, while enabling seamless communication with caregivers and healthcare professionals. This chapter details the software development approach, design decisions, implementation, and testing strategies employed throughout the project lifecycle.

## Software Development Approach

### Used Approach
The project adopted the **Agile Software Development** methodology, specifically leveraging the Scrum framework. Agile was chosen for its iterative nature, flexibility, and ability to accommodate evolving requirements, which is crucial in healthcare-related applications where user feedback and regulatory compliance are paramount.

### Justification of the Approach Used
Agile allows for continuous integration of user feedback, rapid prototyping, and incremental delivery of features. This approach ensured that the HCE app could adapt to the needs of elderly users, caregivers, and healthcare professionals, resulting in a user-centric and robust solution.

### Phases of the Chosen Model Approach
1. **Requirement Gathering & Analysis**: Engaged stakeholders (elderly users, caregivers, doctors) to define core features.
2. **Design**: Created wireframes, UML diagrams, and database schemas.
3. **Implementation**: Developed the backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB), frontend (Flutter), and sensor integration (ESP8266 with MAX30105 sensor).
4. **Testing**: Conducted unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
5. **Deployment & Feedback**: Released MVP for pilot testing and collected feedback for further iterations.

### Why is it Better Than Other Approaches?
Compared to the Waterfall model, Agile provides greater flexibility and responsiveness to change. Unlike V-Model or Spiral, Agile's focus on collaboration and iterative delivery aligns well with the dynamic requirements of healthcare applications.

### Alternative Approach
A possible alternative would have been the **Waterfall Model**, which offers a linear and structured process. However, its rigidity and lack of iterative feedback make it less suitable for projects where requirements may evolve.

### Software Modeling Tools Used
- **UML Diagrams**: For system architecture and data flow.
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: For visualizing workflows and relationships (see below).
- **Wireframing Tools**: For UI/UX design.

#### Example: System Architecture (Mermaid)
```mermaid

  A[User (Elderly)] -->|Mobile App| B[Flutter Frontend]
  B -->|API Calls| C[Node.js Backend]
  C -->|Sensor Data| D[ESP8266 + MAX30105]
  C -->|Database Ops| E[MongoDB]
  C -->|Notifications| F[Caregiver/Doctor]
```

## Specifications That Distinguish This Software from Other Software
- **Real-time Health Monitoring**: Integration with ESP8266 and MAX30105 for live heart rate and SpO2 readings.
- **Role-based Access**: Separate interfaces and permissions for patients, companions, and doctors.
- **Location-based Services**: Nearby healthcare facilities and pharmacies.
- **Secure Messaging**: Encrypted communication between users and healthcare providers.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Designed for elderly users with accessibility in mind.

## Implementation

### User Interface
The UI was developed using Flutter, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and a responsive design. The interface prioritizes large buttons, clear fonts, and intuitive navigation for elderly users.

### Code
The project is divided into three main components:
- **Frontend (Flutter)**: Handles user interaction and visualization.
- **Backend (Node.js/Express)**: Manages business logic, authentication, and data storage.
- **Sensor Firmware (ESP8266/Arduino)**: Reads sensor data and communicates with the backend.

#### Example: Backend Reading Model (Node.js)
```javascript:d:\.work\.TRAE\HCE\HCE_APP\hce-backend\models\reading.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const readingSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  userId: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User',
    required: true,
  },
  heartRate: {
    type: Number,
    required: true,
  },
  spo2: {
    type: Number,
    required: true,
  },
  timestamp: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
  location: {
    latitude: { type: Number },
    longitude: { type: Number },
  },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Reading', readingSchema);
```

#### Example: Sensor Simulation (Python)
```python:d:\.work\.TRAE\HCE\HCE_APP\hce-backend\test\esp_sensor_simulation.py
# Simulates heart rate and SpO2 readings for testing
@app.route('/readings')
def get_readings():
    # ... existing code ...
    return jsonify({
        "status": "success",
        "heartRate": round(calculated_bpm, 1),
        "spo2": round(displayed_spo2, 1),
        "beatsDetected": beat_count,
        "timestamp": time.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.000Z", time.gmtime())
    })
```

### Database
MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility and scalability. Collections include users, readings, messages, and locations. The schema supports role-based access and geospatial queries for location-based services.

#### Example: Database Entity Relationship (Mermaid)
```mermaid
erDiagram
  USER ||--o{ READING : has
  USER ||--o{ MESSAGE : sends
  USER ||--o{ LOCATION : visits
  READING }o--|| LOCATION : recorded_at
```

## Issues and Problems Faced in the Project
- **Sensor Integration**: Challenges in stable communication between ESP8266 and backend.
- **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring reliable heart rate and SpO2 readings.
- **User Authentication**: Implementing secure, role-based access.
- **UI Accessibility**: Designing for elderly users with varying levels of tech literacy.
- **Testing Hardware**: Simulating sensor data for backend testing.

## Testing

### White Box Testing
